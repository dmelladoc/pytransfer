# PyTransfer

A quick script to upload  (and download, soon) files using [transfer.sh](https://transfer.sh).

Adapted from [transfersh-cli](https://github.com/tanrax/transfersh-cli). Check their project!

## Current TODOs:
* Return delete code for deletions.
* Download a file, showing a progress bar of process.
* `zip` support? (Compress a folder and zip it)
